# About 💻
I was in a week when the dollar was falling a lot and so I thought, how about I know in real time on my cell phone how much the dollar is worth? So I developed this app :)
The app consists of a currency converter using the AwesomeAPI public api.

A lot of experience has been gained with this app, I feel very happy to have finished it. 😀

The app was built with:
- Typescript
- React Native
- Expo CLI
- React Native Elements
- Styled-Components
